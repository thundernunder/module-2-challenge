                    Originally from San Jose, CA, Nathan made his way to Southern California by attending California State University, Long Beach. There, Nathan worked in the Athletics Development Department at CSULB, and was hired by Mater Dei High School in 2016. In six years at Mater Dei, Nathan grew in his responsibilities and held multiple titles, including Coordinator of Admissions Marketing and Alumni Relations and Director of Admissions Marketing. Although I enjoyed my time in private education, I'm looking forward to the next step in my career as I pursue a career in Web Development!

                    Nathan loves sports, and played baseball at Long Beach State University. However, it's Nathan's characteristic as a closet nerd that more defines him. Nate loves videogames, and is a particularly devout fan of the Final Fantasy, Elder Scrolls, and Fallout franchises. Nathan is also very excited about the return of the Fable franchise. In addition, Nathan also loves to read books of all genres. He's currently reading <em>Darth Plagueis</em> from the Star Wars Legends library, and his favorite Star Wars book(s) is the <em>Han Solo Trilogy</em> by A.C. Crispin. Don't @ me. Nathan recently completed <em>City of Thieves</em> by David Benioff and highly recommneds it if anyone is interested.
