Nathan Underwood - Module 2 Challenge

This Challenge gives me the opportunity to build my first website from scratch in the UCI Bootcamp program. The driving vehicle of this project is to build my first Website Portfolio page, presenting me the opportunity to update the page as I learn new skills and build new programs.  

Building this page allowed me to demonstate my knowledge of the completed HTML and CSS units of the UCI Full-Stack Bootcamp. I enjoyed formatting the different sections of the webpage so they line up. I also enjoyed learning how to apply cool CSS affects like glow and underline using the hover property. 

Here is a screenshot of what the functioning webpage should look like:
